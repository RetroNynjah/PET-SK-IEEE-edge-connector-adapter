# PET SK IEEE-488 to edge connector adapter

Many accessories for the CBM PET are desgined for models which have an edge connector for IEEE-BUS while the PET 8032-SK/8096-SK/200 has a standard IEEE-488 connector. That's a D-shaped connector which is sometimes called GPIB connector or Centronix connector.  
This cheap adapter converts from the standard IEEE-488 port on the SK models to a card edge so that standard PET accessories with edge connectors can be used.

The adapter is very simple. It has straight connections from one side to the other. The part count can't get much lower as it only contains one component except for the PCB, a male right-angled IEEE-488 connector.
